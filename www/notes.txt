We need to combile Rust to WebAssembly(WASM) code
WASM can be executed in the browser
Unlike Javascript, it runs at almost native speed
It's suitable for 3D apps, CAD, Virtual Reality, system applications, games, etc.
Something that requires a lot of resources and has to be performant
WebAssembly can handle it

Backend: Rust supports compiling into WASM 
Frontend: Javascript
